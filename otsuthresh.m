function [T, SM] = otsuthresh(h)
%OTSUTHRESH Computes Otsu's optimum threshold from  a histogram.
%   [T, SM] = OTSUTHRESH(H) computes an optimum threshold, T, in the range
%   [0, 1] using Otsu's method on a given a histogram, H.

% Normalize the histogram to unit area. If h is already normalized, the
% following operation has no effect.
h = h/sum(h);
h = h(:);   % h must be a column vector for processing below.

% All possible intensities represented in the histogram ( 256 for 8 bits):
c = (1:numel(h))'; % c must be a column vector for processing below.
% Values of P1 for all values of k.
P1 = cumsum(h);

% Values of the mean for all values of k:
m = cumsum(c .* h);

% The image mean:
mG = m(end);

% The between-class variance:
sigSquared = ((mG*P1 - m).^2) ./ (P1 .* (1 - P1) + eps);

% Find the maximum of sigSquared. The index where the max occurs is the
% optimum threshold. There may be several max values. If so, average them
% to obtain the final threshold.
maxSigsq = max(sigSquared);
T = mean(find(sigSquared == maxSigsq));

% Normalized T to the range [0,1]. 1 is subtracted because MATLAB indexing
% starts at 1, but image intensities start at 0.
T  = (T-1)/(numel(h) - 1);

% Separability measure:
SM = maxSigsq/sum((((c - mG).^2).*h) + eps);
