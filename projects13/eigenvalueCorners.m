function g = eigenvalueCorners(f, T)
%eigenvalueCorners Detects Corners in an image.
%   G = eigenvalueCorners(F, T) computes corner values at each point in
%   image F, where T is a threshold in the range [0,1], independently of
%   the clas of the input image. T defaults to 0.05.
%
%   This function is based on a method proposed in: J. Shi and C. Tomsi.
%   "Good Features to Track," Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on
%   Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Jun 1994, pp. 593-600.
%   The procedure is simply to implement Eq. (13-50) in DIPUM3E. See also
%   Gonzalez and Woods [2018].

%   Hints: Use MATLAB function gradient to compute the derivatives, paying 
%   attention to the fact that this function uses a (c, r) coÂ­ordinate format. 
%   Also, because matrix C is symmetric and is only of size 2x2, you can use 
%   Eq. (13-50) to compute the eigenvalues.
