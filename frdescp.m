function z = frdescp(s)
%FRDESCP Computes Fourier descriptors.
%   Z = FRDESCP(S) computes the Fourier descriptors of S, which is an
%   np-by-2 sequence of ordered boundary coordinates.
%
%   Because of symmetry requirements, the number of points in S must be
%   even if Z is to be used later to compute the inverse. If the number of
%   points is odd, FRDESCP duplicates the last point. If a different
%   treatment is desired, the sequence must be processed externally so that
%   it has an even number of points.
%
%   See function IFRDESCP for computing the inverse descriptors.
