function image = bound2im(b,M,N)
%BOUND2IM Converts a boundary to an image.
%   IMAGE = BOUND2IM(b) converts b, an np-by-2 array containing the
%   integer coordinates of a boundary, into a binary image with 1s in
%   the locations of the coordinates in b and 0s elsewhere. IMAGE is the
%   smallest image that will contain the boundary.
%
%   IMAGE = BOUND2IM(b,M,N) places the boundary in a region of size
%   M-by-N. M and N must satisfy the following conditions:
%
%       M >= max(b(:,1)) - min(b(:,1)) + 1 
%       N >= max(b(:,2)) - min(b(:,2)) + 1 
%
%   Typically, M = size(f,1) and N = size(f,2), where f is the image
%   from which the boundary was extracted. In this way, the coordinates
%   of IMAGE and f are comparable.
%   
%   The ouput image is of class logical.
