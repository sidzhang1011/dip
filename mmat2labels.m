function L = mmat2labels(R)
%MMAT2LABELS Convert membership matrix to vector of class labels.
%   L = MMAT2LABELS(R) converts membership matrix R to vector L of
%   numerical labels. R is of size NC-by-N where NC is the number of
%   classes, and N is the number of pattern vectors or images. L is of
%   size N-by-1. As explained in Sections 14.SS and 14.SS, R(:,k) has a
%   1 in the jth position if the kth pattern vector or image belongs to
%   class j.
