function [I,R] = getMNISTimages(NI,type,order,classLabels)
%getMNISTimages Extracts images from the MNIST database.
%
%   [I,R] = getMNISTimages([], TYPE) extracts all the images of TYPE
%   ('training' or 'test') and the corresponding class membership
%   matrix, R, from the MNIST database.
%
%   [I,R] = getMNISTimages(NI,TYPE,'random') extracts NI total images of
%   TYPE ('training' or 'test') and the corresponing R, chosen at random
%   from the MNIST database.
%
%   [I,R] = getMNISTimages(NI,TYPE,START,CLASSLABELS) extracts from the
%   MNIST database NI TYPE images of each of the classes specified in
%   vector CLASSLABELS, starting at image number START. The total number
%   of images estracted is NI*numel(CLASSLABELS). If CLASSLABLES is
%   either [] or is omitted, it defaults to all ten classes. Valid
%   values of START are 1 <= START <= 60000 for images from the training
%   set and 1 <= START <= 10000 for images from the test set.
%
%   Output I contains that extracted images. It is of size
%   28-by-28-by-depth-by-NI*numel(classLabels) which is the format
%   required by the functions in the DIPUM3E CNNToolbox. The images are
%   grayscale, so depth = 1.
%
%   Output R is the membership matrix of the images in I. It is of size
%   numel(classLabels)-by-NI*numel(classLabels)
%
%   The total number of possible classes of the output images is ten,
%   with the following names and cnn classification labels:
%
%     Class Name         Classification Label
%
%      zero                      1
%      one                       2
%      two                       3
%      three                     4
%      four                      5
%      five                      6
%      six                       7
%      seven                     8
%      eight                     9
%      nine                     10

%
%   NOTE 0: All MNIST images are in the file mnist_uint8.mat which is
%   contained the folder MNIST_Images in the DIPUM3E Support Pakage.
%   This folder must be added to the MATLAB path.
%
%   NOTE 1: All output images are in image class double format, with
%   values in the range [0 1].
%
%   NOTE 2: As of this writing the MNIST dataset can be downloaded from
%   http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html.
%   The database consists of four files: ,'train_x', 'train_y',
%   'test_x', 'test_y' Place these files in the MATLAB workspace and
%   save the workspace as mnist_uint8.mat. Place this file in the MATLAB
%   path. This function will unpack the mat file and format the images
%   in a form suitable for use with the DIPUM3E CNNToolbox.
%
%   NOTE 3: If numel(classes) < 10, then R will be reformatted so that
%   its number of rows equals the number of classes, as required by the
%   definition of the class membership matrix. Thus, the meaning of the
%   original labels will be lost. For example, if classes = [2 4 8],
%   then R will have three rows, and the class labels 2,4,8 will become
%   1,2,3.
%
%   NOTE 4: HOW THE RAW MNIST DATA IS ORGANIZED.
%	 The training data in the original database is organized as a matrix,
%	 train_x, of size 60000-by-784, each column of which are the
%	 components of the 28-by-28 images of numbers. A similar matrix,
%	 train_y, of size 60000-by-10 contains the labels (class membership)
%	 of the samples. This is a binary matrix, each column of which is all
%	 0s, except at the location correponding to the pattern corresponding
%	 to that column. This is the membership matrix R discussed in Chapter
%	 14 of DIPUM3E. The testing data consists of 10000 samples, organized
%	 as above, with the names test_x and test_y.
