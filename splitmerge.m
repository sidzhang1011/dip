function g = splitmerge(f, mindim, fun)
%SPLITMERGE Segments an image using a split-and-merge algorithm.
%   G = SPLITMERGE(F,MINDIM,@PREDICATE) segments image F by using a 
%   split-and-merge strategy based on quadtree decomposition. MINDIM (a 
%   nonnegative integer power of 2) specifies the minimum dimension of 
%   the quadtree regions (subimages) allowed. If necessary, the program 
%   pads the input image with zeros to the nearest square size that is 
%   an integer power of 2. This guarantees that the algorithm used in
%   the quadtree decomposition will be able to split the image down to 
%   blocks of size 1-by-l. The result is cropped back to the original
%   size of the input image. Each connected region in output G is 
%   labeled with a different integer.
%
%   Note that in the function call we use ^PREDICATE for the value of 
%   fun. PREDICATE is a user-defined function that must be in the 
%   MATLAB path. Its syntax is
% 
%       FLAG = PREDICATE(REGION) must return TRUE if the pixels in 
%       REGION satisfy the predicate defined in the body of the
%       function; otherwise, the value of FLAG must be FALSE.
% 
%   The following simple example of function PREDICATE is used in 
%   Example 11.11 in the book. It sets FLAG to TRUE if the intensities 
%   of the pixels in REGION have a standard deviation that exceeds 10,
%   and their mean intensity is between 0 and 125. Otherwise FLAG is set 
%   to FALSE.
%
%                   function flag = predicate(region)
%                   sd = std2(region);
%                   m = mean2(region);
%                   flag = (sd > 0) & (m > 0) & (m < 125);

% Pad the image with zeros to the nearest square size that is an integer
% power of 2. This allows decomposition down to regions of size 1-by-1.
PS = 2^nextpow2(max(size(f)));
[M, N] = size(f);
f = padarray(f, [PS - M, PS - N], 'post');

% Perform splitting first.
Z = qtdecomp(f, @split_test, mindim, fun);

% Then, perform merging by looking at each quadregion and setting all its
% elements to 1 if the block satisfies the predicate defined in function
% PREDICATE.

% First, get the size of the largest block. Use function full because Z is
% sparse.
Lmax = full(max(Z(:)));
% Next, set the output image initially to all zeros. The MARKER matrix is
% used later to establish connectivity.
g = zeros(size(f));
MARKER = zeros(size(f));

% Begin the merging stage.
for K = 1:Lmax
    [vals, r, c] = qtgetblk(f, Z, K);
    if ~isempty(vals)
        % Check the predicate for each of the regions of size K-by-K with
        % coordinates given by vectors r and c.
        for I = 1:length(r)
            xlow = r(I); ylow = c(I);
            xhigh = xlow + K -1; yhigh = ylow + K -1;
            region = f(xlow:xhigh, ylow:yhigh);
            flag = fun(region);
            if flag 
                g(xlow:xhigh, ylow:yhigh) = 1;
                MARKER(xlow, ylow) = 1;
            end
        end
    end
end

% Finally, obtain each connected region and label it with a different
% integer value using function bwlabel.
g = bwlabel(imreconstruct(MARKER, g));

% Crop and exit.
g = g(1:M, 1:N);

function v = split_test(B, mindim, fun)
% This function determines if quadregion B is split. The function returns
% in v logical 1s (TRUE) for the blocks that should be split and logical
% 0s (FALSE) for those that should not.

% Quadregion B, passed by qtdecomp, is the current decomposition of the
% image into K blocks of size m-by-m.

% k is the number of regions in B at this point in the procedure.
k = size(B, 3);

% Perform the split test on each block. If the predicate function (fun)
% returns TRUE, the region is split, so we set the appropriate element of v
% to TRUE. Else, the appropriate element of v is set to FALSE.
v(1:k) = false;
