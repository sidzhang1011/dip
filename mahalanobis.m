function D = mahalanobis(varargin)
%MAHALANOBIS Computes the Mahalanobis distance.
%   D = MAHALANOBIS(Y,X) computes the Mahalanobis distance between each
%   vector in Y to the mean (centroid) of the vectors in X and outputs the
%   result in vector D, whose length is size(Y,1). The vectors in X and Y
%   are assumed to be organized as rows of these matrices. The input data
%   can be real or complex. The outputs are real quantities.

%   D = MAHALANOBIS(Y, CX, MX) computes the Mahalanobis distance between
%   each vector in Y and the given mean vector, MX. The results are output
%   in vector D, whose length is size(Y, 1). The vectors in Y are assumed
%   to be organized as the rows of this array. The input data can be real
%   or complex. The outputs are real quantities. In addition to the mean
%   vector MX, the covariance matrix CX of a popultion of vectors X must be
%   provided also. Uses custom function COVMATRIX.
