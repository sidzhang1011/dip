function R = strsimilarity(a,b)
%STRSIMILARITY Similarity measure between two character vectors.
% R = STRSIMILARITY(A,B) computes the similarity measure, R, defined
% in Eq. (14-22) between character vectors A and B. The vectors do not
% have to be of the same length, but they should be otherwise
% registered for this method to make sense. All blanks in both vectors
% are deleted, so they should not be used as valid characters in
% defining A and B. Inputs can be either character vectors or scalar
% strings, in the sense defined by MATLAB. If the inputs are strings
% they are converted to character vectors.

% If inputs are scalar strings, covert them to character vectors. If
% they already are character vectors, they are not affected by the 
% following function.

if (isstring(a) && isstring(b)) || (ischar(a) && ischar(b))
    a = convertStringsToChars(a);
    b = convertStringsToChars(b); 
else
    error('a and b must both be character vectors or both be strings') 
end

% Make sure the inputs are character vectors and not higher-dimensional 
% character arrays.
if ~(size(a,1) == 1 || size(a,2) == 1) && ~(size(b,1) == 1 || size(b,2) == 1)
    error('a and b must be character vectors') 
end

% Make sure they are rows for dimensional consistency later on. 
a = a(:)';
b = b(:)';

% Remove all blanks. 
a = a(~isspace(a)); 
b = b(~isspace(b));

% Pad the end of the shorter string. 
La = length(a);
Lb = length(b);

if La > Lb
    b = [b,blanks(La - Lb)];
else
    a = [a,blanks(Lb - La)];
end

% Compute the similarity measure. 
I = find(a == b);
alpha = numel(I);
den = max(La,Lb) - alpha;
R = alpha/den;
