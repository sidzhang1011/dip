function s = ifrdescp(z, nd)
%IFRDESCP Computes inverse Fourier descriptors.
%   S = IFRDESCP(Z, ND) computes the inverse Fourier descriptors of Z,
%   which is a sequence of Fourier descritptors obtained, for example, by
%   using function FRDESCP. ND is the number of descriptors used to compute
%   the inverse; ND must be an even integer no greater than length(Z), and
%   length(Z) must be even also. If ND is omitted, it defaults to
%   length(Z). The output, S, is matrix of size length(Z)-by-2 containing
%   the coordinates of a closed boundary.
%
%   See function FRDESCP for computing the descriptors.

% Preliminaries.
np = length(z);
% Check inputs.
if nargin == 1
    nd = np;
end
if np/2 ~= round(np/2)
    error('length(z) must be an even integer.');
elseif nd/2 ~= round(nd/2)
    error('nd must be an even integer.');
end

% Create an alternating sequence of 1s and -1s for use in centering the
% transform (see Gonzalez and Woods [2018]).
x = 0:(np - 1);
m = ((-1) .^ x)';

% Use only nd descriptors in the inverse. Because the descriptors aare
% centered, (np - nd)/2 terms from each end of the sequence are set to 0.
d = (np - nd)/2;
z(1:d) = 0;
z(np-d+1:np) = 0;

% Compute the inverse and convert back to obtain the boundary coordinates.
zz = ifft(z);
s(:,1) = real(zz);
s(:,2) = imag(zz);

% Multiply by alternating 1 and -1s to undo the centering done in functio0n
% frdescp.
s(:,1) = m .* s(:,1);
s(:,2) = m .* s(:,2);
